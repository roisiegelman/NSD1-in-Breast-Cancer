# Elucidating the role of NSD1  in breast cancer heterogeneity progression

###  introduction
Breast cancer is one of the world's most common types of cancer. It is an aggressive, highly heterogeneous disease caused by mammary epithelial cell changes driven by genetic and epigenetic alterations. Reversible epigenetic regulation promotes breast cancer heterogeneity between and within tumors' cells by enabling cellular plasticity.

On a molecular level, tumors can be classified into subtypes based on a combination of histopathology of the primary tumor and the expression pattern of hormones estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The proliferative capacity of the tumor cells, as measured by the Ki67 marker, also contributes to tumor classification. Recent technological advances also implemented genomic and transcriptomic profiling for classification6. Of the five main breast cancer subtypes, Luminal A and B express hormone receptors. Luminal A displays low Ki67 and are HER2 negative, whereas luminal B tumors express high levels of Ki67 and can be either HER2 positive or negative. Normal-like tumors expresses hormone receptors but not HER2 and Ki67 as well as additional genomic and transcriptomic profiling6. HER2 positive, as its name applies, expresses amplified HER2 but not hormone receptors. Finally, basal-like breast cancer (by-and-large overlapping with triple-negative breast cancer, TNBC) is defined by a lack of expression of hormonal receptors and HER2^7.
our understanding of the relationship between histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) and the capacity of mammary tumor cells to develope is limited. In this project, relying on recent findings, I will explore the role of a specific histone modification, H3K36me2, and its central modulator, NSD1, in promoting n breast cancer.![image](https://github.com/roisiegelman/Project/assets/166688546/898795ce-b799-4cec-89cc-2ca37f4a3c0b)

Nuclear receptor binding SET domain (NSD) proteins consist of NSD1, NSD2, and NSD3. These proteins participate in the regulation of tumor initiation and progression. However, the biological functions of NSD family  in BC progression remain unclear. 
We here purposed to explore the underlying mechanisms and biological functions of NSD1 in BC progression. We formulated a hypothesis that NSD1 would strengthen BC cell drug resistance and lead to poor prognosis in patients with BC.

###  main goals

(1)  explore the effect of NSD1 gene expression on the overall survival of BC patients with different subtypes 

(2)

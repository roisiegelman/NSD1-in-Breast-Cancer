Breast cancer is one of the world's most common types of cancer. It is an aggressive, highly heterogeneous disease caused by mammary epithelial cell changes driven by genetic and epigenetic alterations. Reversible epigenetic regulation promotes breast cancer heterogeneity between and within tumors' cells by enabling cellular plasticity.

our understanding of the relationship between histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) and the capacity of mammary tumor cells to alter their identity is limited. In this study, relying on recent findings, I will explore the role of a specific histone modification, H3K36me2, and its central modulator, NSD1, in promoting cellular plasticity and tumor heterogeneity in breast cancer.![image](https://github.com/roisiegelman/Project/assets/166688546/898795ce-b799-4cec-89cc-2ca37f4a3c0b)

Nuclear receptor binding SET domain (NSD) proteins consist of NSD1, NSD2, and NSD3. These proteins participate in the regulation of tumor initiation and progression. However, the biological functions of NSD family  in BC progression remain unclear. 
We here purposed to explore the underlying mechanisms and biological functions of NSD1 in BC progression. We formulated a hypothesis that NSD1 would strengthen BC cell drug resistance and lead to poor prognosis in patients with BC.

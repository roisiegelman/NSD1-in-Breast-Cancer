Breast cancer is one of the world's most common types of cancer. It is an aggressive, highly heterogeneous disease caused by mammary epithelial cell changes driven by genetic and epigenetic alterations. Reversible epigenetic regulation promotes breast cancer heterogeneity between and within tumors' cells by enabling cellular plasticity. Conversely, plasticity, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition or luminal-to-basal-like cell transition, can worsen the cancer prognosis. However, our understanding of the relationship between histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) and the capacity of mammary tumor cells to alter their identity is limited. In this study, relying on recent findings, I will explore the role of a specific histone modification, H3K36me2, and its central modulators, NSD family members, in promoting cellular plasticity and tumor heterogeneity in breast cancer.![image](https://github.com/roisiegelman/Project/assets/166688546/898795ce-b799-4cec-89cc-2ca37f4a3c0b)

Nuclear receptor binding SET domain (NSD) proteins consist of NSD1, NSD2, and NSD3. These proteins participate in the regulation of tumor initiation and progression. Increasing evidence has proven that NSD family is involved in BC initia
tion and progression. For example, NSD3, located on the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1-like 1 (WHSC1L1) gene, is upregulated in BC cell lines, facilitating the progression of BC [21]. Higher NSD2 expression in BC cell lines contributes to cancer recurrence and unfavorable prognosis [22]. However, the biological functions of NSD1 in BC progression remains unclear. As reported, NSD1 is a potential target for cancer diagnosis and treatment. For example, hypermethylation mediated by NSD1 is related to a poor prognosis in patients with high- risk neuroblastoma [23]. Deregulation of DNA methylation induced by NSD1 silencing in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma indicates a good prognosis [24]. The result of Kaplan Meier survival curves indicate that NSD1 upregulation is positively correlated with unfavorable prognosis. Moreover, NSD1 is reported to regulate hepatocellular
noma progression through the Wnt/Î²-catenin
naling pathway [19].
We here purposed to explore the underlying mechanisms and biological functions of NSD1 in BC progression. We formulated a hypothesis that NSD1 would strengthen BC cell drug resistance and lead to poor prognosis in patients with BC.
